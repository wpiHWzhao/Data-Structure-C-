# Data Structure and Algorithms in C++
This repo is a collection of data structure and algorithms in C++
### Algorithms:
In `vector/src`:   

* Bubble Sort -- Complexity O(n^2^)
* Merge Sort -- Complexity O(nlogn)

In `List/src`:  

* Selection Sort --  Complexity O(n^2^)
* Insertion Sort -- Complexity O(n^2^)
